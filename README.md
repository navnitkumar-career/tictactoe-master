# TicTacToe [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/romankh3/tictactoe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/romankh3/tictactoe)
My own implementation of the  paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a NÃ—M grid and with customising count of the coincidence.
Implemented in the CommandLine. 
## Getting Started
For starting you should clone the project and run.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/romankh3/tictactoe
$ cd tictactoe/
$ ./gradlew run
```
### Notes
After running `./gradlew run` should set next fileds from CommandLine:
- Set height of the border.
- Set width of the border.
- Set the count of the coincidence.

### I hope this project/post is useful to you! Thank you for reading.
